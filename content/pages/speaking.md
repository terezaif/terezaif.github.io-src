Summary: Speaker Information

# I am passionate about speaking because I believe that each of us can leave more than we take. As a public speaker I aim to raise awareness, motivate, and ultimately introduce you to something new.

###_Who I am as a speaker._

Community engagement and curiosity have greatly empowered me as a technologist. Some of my most successful talks and workshops have emerged as a result conference driven learning. That is, first apply for a talk/workshop with deadline and then do the learning for it.

I like public speaking for two reasons, one is that I often see people in industry struggle with topics I've already gone through, so knowledge sharing. And another is that I want to inspire other people to learn new things, to have confidence they can learn new things and to speak about it. Thus, in my talks, I refrain about making assumptions about things being easy and obvious.

As an educator and consultant, I've taught and worked with many diverse populations. Therefore I won't participate in events that lack a [Code of Conduct](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq) or do not have a diverse lineup. I frequently teach workshops (often of my own creation) at [PyLadies Hamburg](https://hamburg.pyladies.com) and often speak at home grown, community conferences. Curious in seeing some of my talks? Various slides from my talks can be found on my [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/terezaif). Additionally my talking history can be found [here](/talks.html).

###_Where am I speaking next and what's my availability._ 

I'm accepting *virtual only* speaking opportunities through the end of 2021. That said, let's try something creative! What are you thinking?

###_Hai sa vorbim Româna. Poti sa vorbesti in Româna pentru comunitatea noastra?_

Da! Particip cu drag la evenimente in România care au scopul de a dezvolta si diversifica comunitatiile the data science locale.  

###_What you can expect from me._

I tote my own equipment - that is a MacBook Pro. I often employ a slide stack using Keynote/Pdf. If you require additional equipment, please communicate that in your request. 

More questions or have a propose in mind? Please drop me a [line](mailto:terezaif@gmail.com?subject=Speaking+Inquiry), I'd love to chat!

###_Therefore, what can I expect from you._

An animated and researched talk, well prepared with slides available for review well before the conference (as defined by the speaker agreement)!

Preparing a talk involves hours of preparation including research, writing, and countless hours of etc work. If you are from a for profit conference depending on the speaking opportunity you inquire about that can impact the speaking honorarium/fee. At the minimum, travel and lodging accommodations are expected. Not sure what you can support? Reach [out](mailto:terezaif@gmail.com?subject=Speaking+Inquiry)! For community conferences I am happy to discuss financial support as well. 

Workshops, in short, require payment and depend on the length of workshop required and more.
